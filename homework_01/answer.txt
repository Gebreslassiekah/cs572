Second: - console.log ([1,3,4,2,1,5]. removeNum (1)) will be added to the stack and executed. When it executed, it called the function remoeNum. setTimeout (function cb () {...}) is added to the Call Stack.
When setTimeout (function cb () {...}) is executed. The browser creates a timer as part of the Web APIs. It is going to handle the countdown for you.

Console.log(‘Finish’) will add to the stack and executed. After executed it removed from the stack
